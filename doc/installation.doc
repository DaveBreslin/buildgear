      <title> Supported GNU/Linux Distributions </title>

      <para>
         Build Gear is tested with the latest Ubuntu release which is currently
         Ubuntu 14.10 (64-bit). Installation on other GNU/Linux distributions
         is not officially supported. However, installing and building on other
         distributions might work, especially if they are based on Debian - but
         do so on your own risk.

   <section>
      <title> Installing From Source </title>

      <para>
      To build the Build Gear tool successfully you need to install the
      following build dependecies:
      </para>

<screen>$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-gnutls-dev libncurses5-dev unzip</screen>

      <para>
         Then build and install Build Gear using standard configure and make
         options. For example:
      </para>

<screen>$ wget http://buildgear.io/release/buildgear-PACKAGE_VERSION.tar.xz
$ tar xf buildgear-PACKAGE_VERSION.tar.xz
$ cd buildgear-PACKAGE_VERSION
$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/opt/buildgear
$ make
$ make install</screen>

      <para>
         The following two steps are not be necessary if you install Build Gear system wide (ie. --prefix=/usr).
      </para>

      <para>
         To add Build Gear to your path, do eg.:
      </para>

<screen>$ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/opt/buildgear/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc</screen>

      <para>
         To enable Build Gear bash auto completion, do eg.:
      </para>
<screen>$ echo 'source $HOME/opt/buildgear/etc/bash_completion.d/buildgear-bash-completion.sh' >>~/.bashrc</screen>

   <section><title>Installing From Ubuntu PPA</title>

      <para>
         Build Gear can be installed via Ubuntu PPA:
      </para>

<screen>
$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:team-buildgear/buildgear
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install buildgear
</screen>

      <para>
         In case you do not have Ubuntu installed or do not wish to install
         Ubuntu as your system OS, then it is recommended to instead use Build
         Gear with Ubuntu installed in a virtual machine such as VirtualBox,
         Qemu, etc..
      </para>
