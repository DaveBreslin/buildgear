    <title> What is Build Gear? </title>

    <para>
      Build Gear is a lightweight build tool for building embedded firmware. It
      is intended for experienced GNU/Linux users and developers.
    </para>

    <para>
      The primary focus of this build tool is to keep building simple which is
      reflected in a straightforward command line interface and support for
      easy to maintain build files. The secondary focus is build performance
      and build integrity. Build Gear is easy to use and well suited for rapid
      prototyping and product development of GNU/Linux firmware to be deployed
      in small to medium sized embedded systems.

    <title> Why use Build Gear? </title>

    <para>
      In short, use Build Gear because it is simple and because it enables full
      control of how you build your firmware. By design, it offers a high level
      of transparency in regards to how things are built.

  <section><title> History </title>

    <para>
      Build Gear started out as an experimental build tool that I used for
      rapid prototyping of firmware for various GNU/Linux based systems.
    </para>

    <para>
      For years, I've been putting together customized GNU/Linux distributions
      either manually (Linux From Scratch kind of way) or by using some of the
      most popular open source build systems available such as OpenEmbedded and
      Buildroot. Unfortunately, none of these open source build tools suit my
      needs. Both these tools are excellent in each their ways and they both
      offer quite featureful and configurable software distributions but it
      generally comes at the expense of very complex build descriptions (build
      meta data) and also very high levels of abstractions. To be fair,
      OpenEmbedded is certainly the most complex while Buildroot is much less
      complex but still too complex for my taste. In short, what I need is a
      buil tool that is less complex than currently available build tools yet
      still powerful enough to build featureful and fully customized embedded
      firmware.
    </para>

    <para>
      Build Gear is an attempt to create a build tool which does things as
      simple as possible and with the lowest level of information possible in
      order to perform the specific job of building fully tailored embedded
      firmware images for prototype or product hardware.
