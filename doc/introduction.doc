      <title> What is Build Gear? </title>

      <para>
         Build Gear is a lightweight build tool for building embedded firmware.
         Its target audience is experienced GNU/Linux users and developers.
      </para>

      <para>
         The primary focus of this build tool is to keep building simple which
         is reflected in a straightforward command line interface and support
         for easy readable and maintainable build files. The secondary focus is
         build performance and build integrity. Build Gear is easy to use and well
         suited for rapid prototyping and product development of GNU/Linux
         firmware to be deployed in small to medium sized embedded systems.

      <title> Why use Build Gear? </title>

      <para>
         In short, use Build Gear because it is simple and because it enables
         full control of how you build your firmware. By design, it operates in
         simple ways and offers a high level of transparency in regards to how
         things are built. This way it becomes easy to create and customize
         build files which in turn helps ensure a high level of software
         quality. Also, other popular build tools often delivers firmware build
         files (meta data) which is permeated with all sorts of noisy and often
         unwanted configuration code. In contrast, Build Gear is designed to
         allow for quickly and concisely putting together build files from
         scratch which include configuration code and options only relevant for
         the end customer. This way the end customer will get a clean cut
         firmware meta data delivery which is much easier to navigate and work
         with.

      <title> History </title>

      <para>
         Build Gear started out as an experimental build tool used for rapid
         prototyping of firmware for various GNU/Linux based systems.
      </para>

      <para>
         The more complexity introduced in the build meta data the more prone
         the firmware build becomes to build errors and increased maintenance.
         Also, with high complexity it becomes hard to maintain a high level of
         software quality. This cost is overlooked by many existing build
         tools.
      </para>

      <para>
         In response to these issues, Build Gear is an attempt to create a
         build tool which does things as simple as possible and with as little
         infrastructure as possible in order to perform the specific job of
         building fully tailored embedded firmware images for prototypes or
         products.
