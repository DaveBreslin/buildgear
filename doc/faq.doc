      <question>
         <para>
            Why is Build Gear not written in Python or Make like other popular
            build tools?
         </para>
      </question>
      <answer>
         <para>
            Most of the core functionality of the tool is written in C/C++ to
            achieve best build performance. Some of the tool functionality is
            written in a bash helper script. Also, all build files are written
            in bash which makes perfect sense since most install actions and
            descriptions are bash centric.

      <question>
         <para>
            Why does the Mini Distribution rely on so many Ubuntu packages to
            be installed to do a successful build?
         </para>
      </question>
      <answer>
         <para>
            By choice, the Mini Distribution relies on many preinstalled Ubuntu
            packages in order to reduce the total build time. The alternative
            is to build virtually every single native build that your cross
            builds need. This will add significantly to the total build time
            and in most cases not worth the effort. That being said, anyone can
            create their own distribution which include all required native
            builds. Such a distribution will be likely to work with just about
            any build system different from Ubuntu.
