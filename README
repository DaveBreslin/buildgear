=== Build Gear [BETA] ===


1. Introduction

   Build Gear is a lightweight embedded firmware build tool for experienced
   GNU/Linux users and developers.

   The primary focus of this build tool is to make it easy to create and
   maintain fully customized embedded GNU/Linux firmware. This is reflected in
   a straightforward command line interface and support for easy to understand
   build files. The secondary focus is build performance and build integrity.
   Build Gear is easy to use and well suited for rapid prototyping or product
   development of GNU/Linux firmware to be deployed in small to medium sized
   embedded systems.

   NOTE: Build Gear is currently considered beta so things are subject to
         change.  However, the basics are in place and now there are mostly
         fine tuning and bug fixing going on before the planned stable 1.x 
         release series.
