=== Build Gear v0.9.11beta ===

Changes since Build Gear v0.9.10beta:

 * Added parallel build feature

   Added parallel build feature to facilitate faster build times.

   By default this feature is disabled. To enable, simply change the
   "parallel_builds" variable in your Build Gear configuration file to eg. a
   value of 2. This means that maximum two builds can be building at the same
   time.

   Known issue: The build log becomes a mess when building in parallel
   because it is not protected against simultaneous log writes from the
   various builds running in parallel (TO BE FIXED).

   This solution cleans out the old thread implementation in favour of the
   new c++11 threading library. Consequently, a c++11 enabled C++ compiler
   is now required. Generally, this results in a much cleaner implementation.

 * Added configure check for c++11

 * Various cleanups
