    Swapped build system check and download order.

    Moved build system checks ahead of download step to be quickly notified
    of any missing tools/libs before the potential slow download step
    starts.

    Added "show --log-tail" option. Cleanup.

    Also, move ahead check for basic tools required by Build Gear for full functionality.

    Added support for empty .nostrip file.

    It used to be that one had to inject a space character in the .nostrip
    file to force buildgear to not strip any files. Now the strip step is
    skipped entirely if a zero sized .nostrip file exists.
