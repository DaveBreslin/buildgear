=== Build Gear v0.9.10beta ===

Changes since Build Gear v0.9.9beta:

 * Added support for multiple parallel downloads.

   Uses the curl multi interface to facilitate parallel downloads.
   The number of parallel downloads can be set in the config file
   using the download_connections flag.

   The number of connections is limited by the number of lines in
   the terminal. If download_connections is too large for the
   terminal, the number of connections are limited to fit the size
   of the terminal.

 * Reworked buildgear.sh argument parsing

   Reworked buildgear.sh argument parsing to pass arguments by long options
   instead of by environment variables. This makes for a more clean
   environment for each build session (removes BG_* variables from environment).

   NOTE: BG_* variables should not be used in Buildfiles - they are used
   internally by Build Gear and are subject to change.

 * Various cleanups
