=== Build Gear v0.9.13beta ===

Changes since Build Gear v0.9.12beta:

 * Moved download mirror configuration to buildfiles/config

   Moved download mirror configuration to buildfiles/config. The download
   mirror configuration variable is also renamed from download_mirror to
   DOWNLOAD_MIRROR to maintain a consistent variable naming scheme for
   buildfiles/config.

 * Added Build Gear Handbook documentation framework

   Added automake support for pdf and html targets which use docbook to
   produce pdf and html output documentation from a single source.

   The html output is to be used directly on the Build Gear website.
   The pdf output is to be distributed freely.

 * Fixed memory corruption

   Non thread safe manipulation of internal lists resulted in application
   instability by memory corruption. Problem solved by introduction of list
   access mutexes.

 * Various cleanups

Contributed by Jesper Larsen:

 * Include HTTP response codes in output

   Include the HTTP response code in the output if a download fails.

 * Set the user-agent header when downloading

   Download will fail on some sites, if the user-agent header
   is not set.

   The user-agent header is set to curl/x.x.x
   The version is requested through the curl API

 * Stop on syntax errors in Buildfiles

 * Gracefully exit if build fails

   buildgear.sh is made leader of a process group when it is called.
   The script will communicate its PID to buildgear using a named fifo.

   This allows buildgear to kill all build scripts, and their children
   if a build fails.

   This is done in order to ensure that the log of the failing build
   will be written to the build log.

 * Run download procedure in a thread

   This should fix issues with very long delays on signals during downloads.

 * Join log thread when build is done

 * Continue downloads on error

   Instead of exiting right away on a download error we download
   as much as possible. If there are any download errors that could
   not be amended, exit after downloads are done.

 * Source buildfiles config before sourcing Buildfile

 * Update templates to reflect new DOWNLOAD_MIRROR

 * Autocomplete cross/ changes

   Don't suggest cross/ if there are no cross buildfiles in the current tree.
   Don't suggest cross/ if "cross/" is already typed.

 * Add support for buildfiles in bash autocompletion

   The bash autocompletion script finds the root build dir, and makes a
   list of all names defined in Buildfiles.

   "native/" is automatically prefixed to builds in the native directory. I.e.
   $ buildgear build cross[TAB]
   and
   $ buildgear build native/cross[TAB]
   will expand to
   $ buildgear build native/crosstool-ng

 * Support cross/ prefix in bash autocompletion

   $ buildgear build [TAB]
   Will still show cross builds without prefix
   $ buildgear build cross/[TAB]
   Will list all cross builds with prefix

 * Add initial support for deb packaging

   Initial debian packaging directory added.

 * Constant log output in parallel mode

   Constant output to the log in a first-come-first-served basis.

 * Update man pages for whatis compability

 * More fixes to memory corruption

   Added mutex lock for the list iteration loops in build output.

 * Various fixes
