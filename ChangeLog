=== Build Gear v0.9.18beta ===

Changes since Build Gear v0.9.17beta:

Martin Lund:

 * Added log rotation feature

   A new configuration variable "log_rotation" is introduced to enable log
   rotation. The default value is 5 meaning that 5 rotation log files will
   be used like so:

   build/build.log
   build/build.log.1
   build/build.log.2
   build/build.log.3
   build/build.log.4
   build/build.log.5

   The oldest log file is build.log.5 and the latest is build.log .

   Logs are rotated every time the build command is used.

 * Configure text cleanup

 * Fixed pthread linker error

   Using gcc 4.7.3 on Ubuntu 13.04 requires the "-lpthread" option.

 * Added layer configuration description.

 * Removed version from SVG titles

   Placed version comment in autogenerated SVG source.

Jesper Larsen:

 * Show download progress for remote files of unknown size

Jeppe Ledet-Pedersen:

 * Support for gcc 4.8 on Arch Linux

 * Increase bash test path length

   On Archlinux /bin/sh is a link to "../usr/bin/bash" and will not fit in the 10
   byte string

 * Add explicit cast to char pointer to avoid gcc 4.8 warning

   This avoids warnings like when building on gcc 4.8:

   cursor.cc: In constructor ‘CCursor::CCursor()’:
   cursor.cc:59:27: warning: deprecated conversion from string constant to ‘char*’ [-Wwrite-strings]
       no_lines = tgetnum("li");
                              ^

 * Test for libcurses/libncurses in addition to termcap

Vasile Popescu:

 * Fix small spelling error in documentation
