Changes since Build Gear v0.9.16beta:

Contributions by Jesper Larsen:

  * Updated man pages

  * Add options to set custom ssh key locations

    The location of the public/private SSH keys used for SFTP/SCP download
    can be configured with buildgear config.

    The location of the public key is set with the keyword ssh_public_key.
    The location of the private key is set with the keyword ssh_private_key.

    Defaults are $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa(.pub)

  * Get supported protocols from curl

    The list of protocols that trigger a remote download is now taken
    runtime from libcurl.

  * Make tar follow symlinks when adding packages

    The default action for tar is to overwrite files and directories
    if they exists. This results in symlinks being overritten in cases
    where a packages contains i.e. /usr/lib64

    Adding --dereference flag makes tar resolve symlinks before extracting
