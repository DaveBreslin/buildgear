=== Build Gear v0.9.23 ===


Changes since Build Gear v0.9.22:

 * Updated handbook

 * Added sensible handbook chapter ids

 * Support builds with no package output

   This feature adds support for buildfiles which include a build()
   function but produces no package output (no files installed in $PKG).

 * Fixed layer name output padding

 * Add rebuild detection based on buildfile checksum

   This means that a build will automatically rebuild if the sha256sum
   checksum of its bash expanded Buildfile changes.

   This is particular useful if you use configurations variables to
   reconfigure the way your firmware is built.

   For example, if you have a configuration variable in the global
   buildfiles configuration file (config/config), eg.:

   CONFIG_AUDIO="alsa"

   And in one or more Buildfiles you use this variable to reconfigure the
   build or change dependencies. For example:

   if [ "$CONFIG_AUDIO" == "alsa" ]
   then
      CONF_OPTIONS+="--audio=alsa"
      depends+=(alsa-lib)
   else
      CONF_OPTIONS+="--audio=oss"
   fi

   Now, if you change the value of CONFIG_AUDIO between builds, then build
   gear will automatically rebuild any build files that uses CONFIG_AUDIO
   because it will detect that the the checksum of the bash expanded
   build file(s) changes by this modification.

 * Renamed .buildgear/.lock to .buildgear/lock

   No need to make the lock file hidden since it is already in a hidden
   directory.

 * Optimized 'show --buildfile' command

   Optimized the 'show --buildfile' command to avoid the use of temporary
   files in /tmp and reduce the number of calls to external programs.

 * Resolve source_dir (SOURCE) path

   The 'source_dir' path was not being resolved which resulted in $SOURCE
   being non-resolved.

   This had the unfortunate effect that builds like crosstool-ng would not
   find the $SOURCE path nor any previously downloaded source. Subsequently
   it would download sources from scratch at every rebuild slowing down the
   build.
