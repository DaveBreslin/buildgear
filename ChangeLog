Build Gear v0.9.8beta Change Log:

 * Added SOURCE_DIR variable to replace use of BG_SOURCE_DIR

   Variables prefixed with BG_ are internal to buildgear and should not be
	used as they are likely to become unavailable in the future.

 * Improved bash autocompletion

   Enabled auto completion for options added both before and after named
   build.

 * Enabled extglob extension for bash

   Enabling the extglob extension allows for file filters to make shorter eg.
   delete expressions, eg.: "rm !(file1 file2)"  (deletes all files except
   file1 and file2).
