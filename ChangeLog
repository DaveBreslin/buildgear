Build Gear v0.9.7beta Change Log:

 * Made dependency resolution specific for the build

   Up until now buildgear always checked that all dependencies were available for
   all buildfiles found ie. not only for those involved in a specific build.
   This is now fixed so that dependency checks are only made for those
   builds involved in the specific build.
