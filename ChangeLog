Changes since Build Gear v0.9.24:

Jesper Larsen:

Martin Lund:

 * Fix autogenerated load-chart SVG output

   In recent releases of EOG (Eye of Gnome) the data points of the
   autogenerated load-chart SVG are displayed incorrectly (looks inverted).

   This is the result of the SVG rendering in EOG now adhering more stricly
   to the SVG standard which specifies that the "height" parameter value
   used in the rect element must be positive only.

   It turns out this is the very reason that the autogenerated SVGs were
   not being displayed with eg. Inkscape which would simply silently ignore
   negative rectangle height value.

   The fixed SVG output has been tested successfully with EOG, Inkscape,
   Firefox, and ImageMagick display.

 * Remove no output files warning

   While it is true there is no package output files there might be output
   files in the $OUTPUT directory.
