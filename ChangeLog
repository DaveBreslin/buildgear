=== Build Gear v0.9.12beta ===

Changes since Build Gear v0.9.11beta:

 * Added dynamic output when building

   During the build stage each active build now includes a spinning activity
   indicator and are dynamically updated. Each activity spinner spins one step
   for each build output line progressed by the related build in progress.

   The end result is a much more beautiful build output and it also gives a
   much better feeling of the level of build activity.

 * Fixed build log handling for parallel builds

   Previously, when building in parallel, the build log got messed up
   because each build process wrote to the build log file at the same time.
   The end result was a very incoherent build log file.

   This is now fixed so that each build process only dumps its log output
   to the build log file when it is finished. Also, the build log file is
   only written to by one build process at a time.
   The end result is a bursting but coherent log.

 * Added man pages

   Man pages have been added for various commands and configuration files.

   Contributed by Jesper Larsen.

 * Added a show --log-mismatch feature

   Running buildgear show --log-mismatch will print footprint/checksum
   mismatches from last build.

 * Show help when bogus command is given

   Contributed by Jesper Larsen.

 * Enabled silent build output

   The automake configuration is now using silent rules which means that
   building buildgear is much less verbose.

 * Various small fixes and cleanups
