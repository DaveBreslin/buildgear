=== Build Gear v0.9.16beta ===

Changes since Build Gear v0.9.15beta:

  * Added handbook documentation (draft)

    This is the first draft of the Handbook documenation. It is currently
    considered incomplete and draft quality. It will steadily improve in the
    upcoming releases.

  * Fixed package creation error

    Interupting the package creation step would lead to an incomplete and
    corrupt package file. To avoid this the package is now written to a
    temporary package file and then in the last step this file is moved to
    the final package file.

  * Updated config.guess

  * Various updates and cleanups

Contributions by Jesper Larsen:

  * Support for internal variables in buildfile show

    Variables that are provided by the buildgear.sh script was not resolved
    in the buildgear show --buildfile command.

    A new action "read" has been added to buildgear.sh to present these
    variables to the buildgear show --buildfile command

  * Set CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL on curl objects

    This is a nasty hack to avoid a bug in libcurl. It might result
    in undesired behavior, if a DNS lookup hangs.

  * Added config for SSL certificate location

    The buildgear config file (.buildgear/config) now supports a paramerter
    'certificate_dir'. This parameter can be used to set a custom location
    of SSL certificates. Default for the parameter is a empty string. This
    makes libcurl choose a location. On Ubuntu that resolves to /ets/ssl/certs.

  * Support for libcurl-gnutls and libcurl-openssl

    The configure script now accepts both libraries

  * Added init --buildfile option to help

  * Do not make error if /bin/sh links to /bin/bash

  * Added a load chart feature

    If a --load-chart option is given to the build command, the CPU load
    and memory usage will be recorded throughout the build. When the build
    is finished the loads are rendered in a svg file that shows the results.

    The svg with the data is located in build/output/load-chart.<build name>.svg

  * Added unzip as a run-time dependency

  * Fix extract of .tgz and .txz files

  * Include optional error message in check functions

  * Make tar itself determine the compression type

  * Add a "Cleaning work dir" step in the output

    Cleaning a large work dir can take some time. Include a step in the output
    to reflect the progress of doing this.

  * Fix support for alternative source dir

  * Rename check_lib to check_exist in template

  * Added --buildfile option to init

    A template for Buildfiles is installed. Running init --buildfile will
    use the template to create a new Buildfile in the current directory.
    If a build name is given, this will be inserted in the name variable of
    the buildfile.

  * Introduce lock file for the build root

    A lock file is used to ensure that multiple instances of buildgear
    are not allowed to run, if they have the possibility of changing data.

    I.e. you cannot run two build commands in the same root dir, but you are
    allowed to run a build command and a show --log commmand.

  * Various updates and cleanups
