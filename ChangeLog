=== Build Gear v0.9.22 ===


Changes since Build Gear v0.9.21:

Jeser Larsen:

 * Add existing file size for resumed downloads

   We want to show the user the progress of the entire file download,
   not just the part downloading in this session.

Kalle Lampila:

 * return error code on exit status, if build failed

Martin Lund:

 * Sort manifest lists alphabetically

  To give a better overview the manifests lists are now sorted by build
  name in alphabetical order.

 * Update buildgear.org to buildgear.io

   Since http://buildgear.io is the new home of Build Gear all references
   have been updated accordingly.

 * Fixed build step stalling on Ubuntu 14.10

   Ubuntu 14.10 includes an updated bash version which apparently includes
   stricter parsing which resulted in buildgear stalling in the build step.

 * Fixed root path resolution in buildgear.sh

   Made resolution of working directory independent of symbolic links. The
   buildfiles environment paths used to vary depending of root path having
   symbolic path elements or not. This is now fixed so all paths are
   resolved to absolute paths (basically ignoring symlinks).

 * Removed debug line
