=== Build Gear v0.9.19beta ===

Changes since Build Gear v0.9.18beta:

Jesper Larsen:

 * Trigger build if source is newer than package

   A (re)build of a Buildfile is triggered if any of the files defined
   in the source variable is of newer date than the package file.

   This includes both remote sources, that have been downloaded to the
   source directory, and the local sources residing along with the Buildfile.

 * Add curl debug function

   Record curl debug information. The information is printed in case a download
   results in a non HTTP related error. Usefull to debug protocols with authentication.

 * Test for CURLSSH_AUTH_AGENT

   CURLSSH_AUTH_AGENT is introduced in curl 7.28. Ubuntu 12.10 comes with
   curl 7.27. If not defined we use CURLSSH_AUTH_PUBLICKEY instead.

 * Use ssh-agent for SSH authentication

   stdin is not availble during the download process, so key passwords must be
   handled by the ssh-agent.

 * bash-completion: Add --manifest

 * bash-completion: Support --manifest-xml and improvements

 * Buildfile: Add method to get Buildfile directory

 * buildmanager: clean --buildfile had wrong suffix

   Checksum files are suffixed with sha256sum, and not sha256

 * Use stat call as fallback when searching directory

   If readdir returns a type DT_UNKNOWN a stat call is made
   in order to determine if the node is a directory.

 * Add ".lock" to gitignore template

 * Updated Copyright information

Torsten Lund:

 * Added manifest feature

   Two new show commands are introduced, eg.:
   buildgear show --manifest fs
   buildgear show --manifest-xml fs

   The first command generates a plain-text manifest file located in
   build/output/manifest.fs.txt and the second command generates a XML
   formatted manifest file located in build/output/manifest.fs.xml .

   The manifest contains various information about the components included in
   the specified build, eg. name, version, license, and description.

Kalle Lampila:

 * Make footprint generation locale-independent

Martin Lund:

 * Updated AUTHORS file

 * manifest: Added description and license support

 * Manifest feature cleanup

 * Added 'show --buildfile' to options list

 * Updated config.guess file
