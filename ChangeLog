=== Build Gear v0.9.15beta ===

Changes since Build Gear v0.9.14beta:

Contributed by Jesper Larsen:

 * Create build directory before we open log file (bugfix)

 * Improved configfile handling

   The config part has been rewritten a bit. Options that are defined in
   the buildgear config files are stored un an unordered_map i.e.
   bg_config["parallel_builds"]. This allows for a more compact code base.

   The config command will now update the config files with the installed
   templates when a option is changed. This will make sure that the config
   files are up-to-date if more options are introduced in the future.

 * Various cleanups
