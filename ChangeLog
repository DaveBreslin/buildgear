=== Build Gear v0.9.24 ===


Changes since Build Gear v0.9.23:

Kalle Lampila:

 * Fix package dependency age compare

 * Fix bug that package is not rebuild even if dependency package is changed

 * Rebuild package, if dependency package is newer

 * Return time_t from Age()-function

   Avoid unnecessary casting to long.

 * Allow run config --global outside buildgear dir

 * Delete outdated package output, if there is not package output anymore. rebuild buildfiles without build() only when needed.

 * Ensure outdated package output deletion

   Delete outdated package output, if there is not package output anymore.

 * Rebuild buildfiles without build() only when needed

   If buildfile has no build rules, it not make output package. So it
   need only mark with build flag only when it has dependence change or
   old output file exist.

Jesper Larsen:

 * Do not expand ` calls for buildfile checksums
